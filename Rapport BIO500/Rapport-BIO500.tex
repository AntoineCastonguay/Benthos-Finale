\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}}

L'étude porte sur le lien entre l'indice de population, sa richesse et
son abondance de la faune benthique des rivières du Québec. Cette
dernière a été réalisée par des étudiants au baccalauréat en écologie à
l'Université de Sherbrooke. Elle participe à contribuer de façon
significative à la compréhension de l'écosystème aquatique de cette
région. Les rivières du Québec abritent une diversité de vie benthique,
qui joue un grand rôle dans le maintien de l'équilibre écologique et de
la santé des écosystèmes aquatiques. Cependant, certaines de ces espèces
sont sensibles au niveau de pollution de l'eau ce qui fait d'eux de bons
indicateurs de la qualité de l'eau. Dans cette étude, les étudiants se
sont penchés sur l'abondance de chaque site ainsi que de leur richesse
en lien avec des facteurs environnent. En examinant cette relation, ils
visent à récolter des informations qui permettront d'aider à
sensibiliser les riverains de la région sur l'effet de la pollution sur
la biodiversité aquatique.

\hypertarget{muxe9thodologie}{%
\section{MÉTHODOLOGIE}\label{muxe9thodologie}}

Les sites d'échantillonnage mesurent 100 m et devront se situer à au
moins 100 m en amont ou en aval (si les conditions en amont sont
inadéquates) d'une zone urbanisée comme route ou d'un pont. Les coups de
filet doivent être fait à des vitesses du courant différents, à des
profondeurs différentes, quelques-uns en bordure et d'autres plus au
centre pour favoriser la capture d'une plus grande diversité de taxons.
Au total, 20 coups de filet seront réalisés. L'échantillonnage commence
en aval du site et s'effectue à l'aide d'un filet troubleau. Il doit
être bien rincé avant de passer à la station suivante pour éviter la
contamination. À la station, une zone d'échantillonner d'une longueur de
50 cm sur une largeur de 30 cm en amont du filet est délimité. Ce
dernier sera enfoncé légèrement dans le substrat afin de ne laisser
aucun organisme en dessous et son ouverture fait face au courant.
Pendant 30 secondes, une personne va frotter les roches et les débris
avec les mains à l'intérieur de la surface à échantillonner. Lorsque les
endroits sont trop profonds, les pieds peuvent être utilisés. Retirer le
filet à contre-courant pour éviter que des organismes s'échappent avec
le courant. Le contenu de chaque coup de filet est transféré dans un
seau à fond grillagé à chaque coup de filet. Le seau est laissé dans une
eau peu profonde et calme pour d'éviter l'assèchement de l'échantillon.
À la fin des 20 coups de filet, les gros débris sont jeté après avoir
été inspectés afin de trouver des organismes et les remettre dans
l'échantillon. Ensuite, l'échantillon doit être rincé à l'eau claire
afin d'enlever les sédiments fins en enfonçant le seau dans l'eau et on
remue délicatement l'échantillon pour le débarrasser des particules les
plus fines, lesquelles s'échapperont par le fond grillagé. L'opération
peut être répétée plusieurs fois. Ensuite, laisser l'eau s'égoutter de
l'échantillon puis transférer le dans un contenant auquel est ajouté de
l'alcool à 95 \%. L'eau restant contenue dans l'échantillon diluera la
solution jusqu'au niveau approprié, soit 70 à 80 \% d'alcool.
L'échantillon total constitué du benthos et des détritus devrait avoir
un volume d'environ 1 litre. Les contenants doivent être étiquetés. Une
étiquette doit être collé sur le pot et doit indiquer la date, le nom de
la rivière, le numéro de la région hydrographique (annexe 1), le numéro
de la station, le nombre de contenants et le nom du bassin versant
principal. Une seconde étiquette est mise à l'intérieur des contenants
en papier imperméable. Il faut s'assurer que les contenants sont bien
scellés et que les organismes sont entièrement recouverts par l'alcool.
Par la suite, l'identification des macroinvertébrés benthiques des
échantillons sont effectués en laboratoire.

\section{DISCUSSION}\label{discussion}}

\hypertarget{bibliographie}{%
\section{BIBLIOGRAPHIE}\label{bibliographie}}

\hypertarget{review-articles}{%
\subsubsection{Review articles}\label{review-articles}}

Review articles present longer critical appraisals of one or more recent
books containing an original contribution or perspective on the book(s)
reviewed. Review articles will be reviewed by the editors and/ or
members of the editorial board. Review articles should be no longer than
6,000 words in length.

\hypertarget{squibs}{%
\subsubsection{Squibs}\label{squibs}}

Squibs are short notes (5,000 words max.) that make a scintillating
point by calling attention to a theoretically unexpected observation
about language, without the need for a developed analysis or solution.

\hypertarget{special-collections}{%
\subsubsection{Special Collections}\label{special-collections}}

Special Collections are papers devoted to a particular topic, and edited
by a team of guest editors. Contributions to special collections are
subject to the normal process of blind peer review. Upon publication,
papers within a special collection will be collated within their own
special collection page. If you are interested in submitting or
guest-editing a Special Collection, please contact
\href{https://www.glossa-journal.org/about/editorialteam/}{the editors}.

\hypertarget{word-limits}{%
\subsubsection{Word limits}\label{word-limits}}

All word limits mentioned above include referencing and citation, but
they exclude appendices, data files and other supplementary material.
Please note that if you have data or supplementary files, they should be
treated as outlined in the section \textbf{data
availability/supplementary files} below, and not as part of the main
submission file.

\hypertarget{permissions}{%
\subsection{Permissions}\label{permissions}}

The author is responsible for obtaining all permissions required prior
to submission of the manuscript. Permission and owner details should be
mentioned for all third-party content included in the submission or used
in the research.

If a method or tool is introduced in the study, including software,
questionnaires, and scales, the license this is available under and any
requirement for permission for use should be stated. If an existing
method or tool is used in the research, it is the author's
responsibility to check the license and obtain the necessary
permissions.

\hypertarget{ss}{%
\section{Style sheet}\label{ss}}

The Glossa style sheet is based on the
\href{http://www.eva.mpg.de/linguistics/past-research-resources/resources/generic-style-rules.html}{The
Generic Style Rules for Linguistics} (December 2014 version), developed
under a CC-BY licence by Martin Haspelmath. It was slightly modified for
Glossa by Waltraud Paul and Guido Vanden Wyngaerd in November 2015, and
again in May 2021.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

\hypertarget{title-page}{%
\subsubsection{Title page}\label{title-page}}

The title should not contain any capitalisation apart from the first
word and words that need capitals in any context. In the final version
of the accepted paper, the title is followed by the first and last name
of the author(s), their affiliation, and e-mail. First names should not
include only initials.

Anonymisation: The names of all authors, affiliations, contact details,
biography (optional) and the corresponding author details must be
completed online as part of the submission process but should not be
added to the submitted files until after editorial acceptance.

\hypertarget{abstract}{%
\subsubsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Articles must have the main text prefaced by an abstract of no more than
250 words summarising the main arguments and conclusions of the article.
A list of up to six key words should be placed below the abstract. The
abstract and keywords should also be added to the metadata when making
the initial online submission. The abstract is automatically attached to
the email message inviting reviewers to review the paper.

\hypertarget{main-text}{%
\subsubsection{Main text}\label{main-text}}

Articles are subdivided into numbered sections (and possibly
subsections, numbered 1.1 etc., and subsubsections, numbered 1.1.1
etc.), with a bold-faced heading in each case. The numbering always
begins with 1, not 0. Section headings do not end with a period, and
have no special capitalisation.

\hypertarget{unnumbered-sections}{%
\subsubsection{Unnumbered sections}\label{unnumbered-sections}}

The conclusion is the last numbered section. It may be followed by
several (optional) unnumbered sections, in this order:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Abbreviations
\item
  Data availability/Supplementary files
\item
  Ethics and consent
\item
  Funding information
\item
  Acknowledgements
\item
  Competing interests
\item
  Authors' contributions
\end{itemize}

Of these, only the Competing interests statement is mandatory, and, if
your paper contains glossed examples, the Abbreviations section. More
explanation on the content of these sections is provided below.

\hypertarget{references}{%
\subsubsection{References}\label{references}}

All references cited within the submission must be listed at the end of
the main text file.

\hypertarget{numbered-examples-and-formulae}{%
\subsection{Numbered examples and
formulae}\label{numbered-examples-and-formulae}}

Examples from languages other than English must \emph{all} be glossed
(with word-by-word alignment) and translated, even if the translation
seems obvious. The Leipzig Glossing Rules are recommended as basic
guidelines, and can be found
\href{http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php}{here}.
A full list of all the glosses used must be provided in the
Abbreviations section. Example numbers are enclosed in parentheses, and
left-aligned. Examples are numbered consecutively. When an earlier
example is repeated, it gets a new number. Example sentences usually
have normal capitalization at the beginning and normal punctuation. The
gloss line has no capitalization and no punctuation.

\ex. \ag. Ich   kenne das Kind, dem du geholfen hast.\\
I.\textsc{nom} know the child.\textsc{acc} \textsc{dem.dat} you.\textsc{nom} helped have\\
\glt `I know the child that you helped.'
\bg. Ich kenne das Kind, dem du nicht geholfen hast. \\
I.\textsc{nom} know  the child.\textsc{acc} \textsc{dem.dat} you.\textsc{nom} \textsc{neg} helped   have\\
\glt `I know the child that you didn’t help.’

When the example is not a complete sentence, there is no capitalization
and no full stop at the end. If the name of the language is added, the
source of the example, or any extra information, this information must
be added on an extra first line of the example (with the name of the
language in
italics).\footnote{Examples in footnotes are numbered with lower case Roman numerals enclosed between brackets:

\ex.
\a. Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
\b. *The child seems sleeping.

More text can follow the example.}

% optional line for the name of the language (italics), source, etc. Note the absence of \exg., instead use \ex. (and \a. \b. for subdivisions) when this optional line is present. Use \exg. etc. if this line is absent (as in the previous example)
\ex. \textit{German} \citep{coetsem:2000} \\
% original foreign language example preceded by \gll
\gll das Kind, dem du geholfen hast\\  
the child.\textsc{nom} \textsc{dem.dat} you.\textsc{nom}  helped have\\ % gloss line
\glt `the child that you helped' % translation, preceded by \glt

Ungrammatical examples can be given a parenthesized idiomatic
translation. A literal translation may be given in parentheses after the
idiomatic translation.

The use of any nonstandard layout in examples beyond what is illustrated
above is strongly discouraged, as this will increase production time
(and cost) of your paper, as well as increase the chances of the HTML
version including errors in some browsers/screen sizes. If you feel an
example needs additional explanation, try as much as possible to provide
this in the text that goes with the example. If nonstandard layout is
essential, then please raise this with the editorial team to discuss the
options available.

Formulae must be proofed carefully by the author. Editors will not edit
formulae. If special software has been used to create formulae, the way
they are laid out is the way they will appear in the publication.

\hypertarget{fn}{%
\subsection{Use of footnotes/endnotes}\label{fn}}

Use footnotes rather than endnotes (we refer to these as `Notes' in the
online publication). These will appear at the bottom of each page. Notes
should be used only where crucial clarifying information needs to be
conveyed.

Avoid using notes for purposes of referencing; use in-text citations
instead. If in-text citations cannot be used, a source can be cited as
part of a note. Please insert the footnote marker after the end
punctuation.

The footnote reference number normally follows a period or a comma,
though exceptionally it may follow an individual word. Footnote numbers
start with 1. Examples in footnotes have the numbers (i), (ii), etc.

\hypertarget{tables-and-figures}{%
\subsection{Tables and figures}\label{tables-and-figures}}

Tables and figures are treated as floats in typesetting. This means that
their placement on the page will not necessarily be where you put them
in your manuscript, as this may lead to large parts of the page ending
up white (e.g.~when a table or figure does not fit on the current page
anymore and wraps onto the following page). For this reason, you must
always refer to tables and figures in the running text, as in the
following example: ``In certain languages, the superlative transparently
contains the comparative morphologically, as illustrated in table
\protect\hyperlink{tbl:table1}{1} \citep[ 46]{Bobaljik2012}.'' Do not
refer to tables and figures using the words ``following'', ``below'' or
``above'', as the final placement of your table or figure may be
different from where you placed them in your manuscript.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllll@{}}
\caption{\{\#tbl:table1\} Morphological containment}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
& \textsc{Pos} & \textsc{Cmpr} & \textsc{Sprl} & \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
& \textsc{Pos} & \textsc{Cmpr} & \textsc{Sprl} & \\

\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Persian & kam & kam-tar & kam-tar-in & `little' \\
Cimbrian & šüa & šüan-ar & šüan-ar-ste & `pretty' \\
Czech & mlad-ý & mlad-ší & nej-mlad-ší & `young' \\
Hungarian & nagy & nagy-obb & leg-nagy-obb & `big' \\
Latvian & zil-ais & zil-âk-ais & vis-zil-âk-ais & `blue' \\
Ubykh & nüs\textsuperscript{w} & c'a-nüs\textsuperscript{w} &
a-c'a-nüs\textsuperscript{w} & `pretty' \\
\end{longtable}

Tables and figures are numbered consecutively. Each table and each
figure has a caption. The caption is placed above figures and tables,
with only the figure or table number in bold. If the caption is not a
complete sentence, it is not followed by a period. Examples are shown in
the captions of table \protect\hyperlink{tbl:table1}{1} and figure
\protect\hyperlink{fig:glossalogo}{1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{glossa} 

}

\caption{The Glossa logo (design by Linnea Vanden Wyngaerd)}\label{fig:fig-glossa}
\end{figure}

Figures should be included in the main text for the purpose of peer
review. Once the paper is accepted, all figures must be uploaded
separately as supplementary files, if possible in colour and at a
resolution of at least 300dpi. No file should be larger than 20MB.
Standard formats accepted are: \textsc{jpg, tiff, gif, png, eps}. For
line drawings, please provide the original vector file (e.g.~.ai, or
.eps).

Tables must be created using a word processor's table function, not
tabbed text. Tables should be included in the manuscript.

Tables should not include:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rotated text
\item
  Colour to denote meaning (it will not display the same on all devices)
\item
  Images
\item
  Diagonal lines
\item
  Multiple parts (e.g.~``table 1a'' and ``table 1b''). These should
  either be merged into one table, or separated into ``table 1'' and
  ``table 2''.
\end{itemize}

If there are more columns than can fit on a single page, the table will
be rotated by 90 degrees to fit on the page. Do not use tables that
cannot fit onto a single page.

Tree diagrams should be treated as examples, not as figures. If your
figure or tree diagram includes text, then for the best match with the
typeset text use the font
\href{https://software.sil.org/charis/download/}{Charis SIL}, or
\href{https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans}{Fira Sans}. These
fonts also support the International Phonetical Alphabet (IPA) symbols.

\hypertarget{in-text-citations}{%
\subsection{In-text citations}\label{in-text-citations}}

The short reference form used in the text consists of the author's
surname and the publication year, followed by page numbers where
necessary. Brackets surround the year, except if the citation is already
inside brackets, in which case there are no brackets around the year. If
there are more than two authors, the first name plus \emph{et al.} can
be used.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet[514]{murray:1983} point out that \ldots{}
\item
  The notation we use to represent this is borrowed from theories
  according to which \(\phi\)-features occur in a so-called feature
  geometry \citep[ 248-250]{mccarthy:1999}.
\item
  Baker et al.~(1989) = \citet{baker:1989}
\end{itemize}

When multiple citations are listed, they are separated by semicolons and
listed in chronological order. Multiple references to the same author do
not repeat redundant information.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Multiple authors have belaboured this point
  \citep{chomsky:1981, chomsky:1986a, chomsky:1986, iverson:1989, casali:1998a, blevins:2004, franks:2005}.
\end{itemize}

Surnames with internal complexity have upper or lower case according to
how the author spells his/her own name, e.g.:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It has been claimed by \citet{swart:1998} and \citet{belder:2011} that
  meaning is compositional.
\end{itemize}

Chinese and Korean names may be treated in a special way: as the
surnames are often not very distinctive, the full name may be given in
the in-text citation, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \ldots the neutral negation \emph{bù} is compatible with stative and
  activity verbs (cf.~Teng Shou-hsin 1973; Hsieh Miao-Ling 2001; Lin
  Jo-wang 2003)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sec:refs}{%
\subsection{References}\label{sec:refs}}

The following rules apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The names of authors and editors should be given in their full form as
  in the publication, without truncation of given names.
\item
  All author and editor names are given in the order ``Lastname,
  Firstname''.
\item
  When there are more than two authors (or editors), each pair of names
  is separated by an ampersand.
\item
  Page numbers of journals are obligatory (issue numbers preferred).
\item
  Journal titles are not abbreviated.
\item
  Main title and subtitle are separated by a colon, not by a period.
\item
  Titles of works written in a language that readers cannot be expected
  to know should be accompanied by a translation, given in square
  brackets \citep{Li1999}.
\item
  No author names are omitted, i.e.~et al.~is not used in the
  references.
\end{itemize}

There are four standard reference types: journal article, book, article
in edited book, thesis. Works that do not fit easily into these types
should be assimilated to them to the extent that this is possible. See
the bibliography at the end of this article for examples.

Surnames with internal complexity are never treated in a special way.
Thus, Dutch or German surnames that begin with \emph{van} or \emph{von}
(e.g.~van Riemsdijk) or French and Dutch surnames that begin with with
\emph{de} (e.g. de Saussure) are alphabetized under the first part, even
though they begin with a lower-case letter. Thus, the following names
are sorted alphabetically as indicated:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Da Milano, Federica
\item
  de Groot, Casper
\item
  De Schutter, Georges
\item
  de Saussure, Ferdinand
\item
  van der Auwera, Johan
\item
  Van Langendonck, Willy
\item
  van Riemsdijk, Henk
\item
  von Humboldt, Wilhelm
\end{itemize}

Capitalise all lexical words (title case) in journal titles and titles
of book series. Capitalise only the first word (plus proper names and
the first word after a colon) for book and dissertation titles, and
article and chapter titles. The logic is to use title case for the
titles that are recurring, lower case for those that are not.

Names of book series are optional; they directly follow the book title,
without intervening punctuation. They appear between brackets, have
title case, and Roman font. They may be accompanied by an (optional)
issue number.

Glossa style in Citation Style Language (CSL) is available
\href{https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=Glossa}{here}. Many thanks to Mark
Dingemanse for creating this style.

\hypertarget{typographical-matters}{%
\subsection{Typographical matters}\label{typographical-matters}}

\hypertarget{capitalisation}{%
\subsubsection{Capitalisation}\label{capitalisation}}

Sentences, proper names and titles/headings/captions start with a
capital letter, but there is no special capitalisation (`title case')
within English titles/headings, neither in the article title nor in
section headings or figure captions. Capitalisation is also used after
the colon in titles, i.e.~for the beginning of subtitles. Capitalisation
in the references section follows its own rules (see section
\protect\hyperlink{sec:refs}{2.6}).

Please refrain from the use of FULL CAPS (except for abbreviations).

\hypertarget{italics}{%
\subsubsection{Italics}\label{italics}}

Italics are used in the following cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  for technical terms and all object-language forms (letters, words,
  phrases, sentences) that are cited within the text, unless they are
  phonetic transcriptions or phonological representations in IPA.
\item
  for emphasis within the text of a particular word that is not a
  technical term.
\item
  for emphasis within a quotation, with the indication \[emphasis
  mine/ours\] at the end of the quotation.
\item
  for the name of the language in examples.
\end{itemize}

In numbered examples, do not use italics to highlight particular parts
of the example; use bold instead.

\hypertarget{small-caps}{%
\subsubsection{Small caps}\label{small-caps}}

Small caps are used for grammatical categories in the interlinear
glosses in examples (e.g.~\textsc{fut, neg, sg, obl}, etc.). They are
also used for indicating stressed syllables or words in example
sentences.

\hypertarget{boldface-and-other-highlighting}{%
\subsubsection{Boldface and other
highlighting}\label{boldface-and-other-highlighting}}

Boldface can be used to draw the reader's attention to particular
aspects of a linguistic example, whether given within the text or as a
numbered example. Full caps, underlining, or italics are not normally
used for highlighting.

\hypertarget{quotation-marks}{%
\subsubsection{Quotation marks}\label{quotation-marks}}

Double quotation marks are used

\begin{itemize}
\item
  when a passage from another work is cited in the text.
\item
  when a technical term or other expression is mentioned that the author
  does not want to adopt.
\end{itemize}

Ellipsis in a quotation is indicated by \[...\].

Single quotation marks are used exclusively for linguistic meanings,
e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Latin \emph{habere} `have' is not cognate with Old English
  \emph{hafian} `have'.
\end{itemize}

Quotes within quotes are not treated in a special way. Note that
quotations from other languages should be translated (inline if they are
short, in a footnote if they are longer).

\hypertarget{abbreviations}{%
\subsubsection{Abbreviations}\label{abbreviations}}

When a complex term that is not widely known is referred to frequently,
it may be abbreviated (e.g.~DOC for ``double-object construction''). The
abbreviation should be given in the text when it is first used.
Abbreviations of uncommon expressions are not used in headings or
captions, and they should be avoided at the beginning of a chapter or
major section.

The abbreviations used in glossed examples should all be listed in a
separate section following the conclusions. For a list of standard
abbreviations, refer to the
\href{https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php}{Leipzig
glossing rules}.

\hypertarget{submission-preparation-checklist}{%
\section{Submission preparation
checklist}\label{submission-preparation-checklist}}

As part of the submission process, authors are required to check off
their submission's compliance with all of the following items, and
submissions may be returned to authors that do not adhere to these
guidelines.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The submission has not been previously published, nor is it being
  considered for publication by another journal (or an explanation has

\section{Publication fees}\label{publication-fees}}

Authors publishing in Glossa face no financial obligation for the
publication of their article. The
\href{https://www.openlibhums.org}{Open Library of Humanities} (OLH)
will take up all fees for publishing. OLH is a charitable organisation
dedicated to publishing open access scholarship, and is funded by an
international consortium of libraries, who wish to make scholarly
publishing fairer, more accessible, and rigorously preserved for the
digital future. Prospective authors are encouraged to check if their
academic library is a funder of OLH.

Authors who have access to funds earmarked for Article Processing
Charges (via a research grant or through their institution) are asked to
use those funds to cover the APC of their publication in Glossa.

Authors without access to such funds will be asked to declare upon
submission that they have contacted their institutional representatives
to check about possible funding for this purpose, and that they have
found that no such funds are available to them. The fees required for
publication will then be paid by the OLH.

\hypertarget{data-availabilitysupplementary-files-optional}{%
\section*{Data availability/Supplementary files
(optional)}\label{data-availabilitysupplementary-files-optional}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Data availability/Supplementary files
(optional)}

The journal encourages authors to make all data associated with their
submission openly available, according to the FAIR principles (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). More information can be found
\href{https://www.glossa-journal.org/about/editorialpolicies/\#data-policy}{\texttt{here}}.

If data/supplementary files are to be associated with the accepted
paper, one of the options below should be followed:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  upload the files to your chosen open repository and make note of the
  DOI that they will provide (most suitable for datasets or information
  that act as foundations to the research being published; this option
  makes the files more findable and more citable).
\item
  upload the files to the journal system during the submission process,
  as `data files'. The journal will then host them as part of the
  publication and provide them with a DOI (most suitable for non-data
  files or very short pieces of information, although option 1 is also
  suitable for these if the author prefers).
\end{enumerate}

In both cases, a `Data availability' or `Supplementary files' section
must be added prior to the reference list that provides a title and very
short summary of the files for each file. If option 1 was selected, you
should also provide the DOI in this section. For example:

Supplementary file 1: Appendix. Scientific data related to the
experiments. DOI:

Ideally, supplementary files are also cited in the main text. Please
note that neither of the above two options will result in the files
being typeset, so please ensure that they are in publishable format when
you upload the accepted paper.
